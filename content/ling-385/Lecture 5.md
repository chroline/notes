# Hopfield Model 3

- Model 1: dx/dt = âˆ’kx, k = .33
   - dynamics of recall
   - for single numbers only
   - gives a sense of the convergence to a memory
- Model 2: learning = average of outer products of memory vectors; memory = noisy input (sensory vector)
   - applies to complex memories, but is algebraic
- Model 3 will combine both
