# Neural Networks for *and* and *or*

- consider the statement: "X" happened and also "Y" happened
   - both activities X and Y must be accomplished for the statement to be considered "true"
   - the absence of either activity renders the statement false
- consider the statement: either "X" happened or "Y" happened
   - statement is considered "true" if only one event, but not both events, takes place

If True is noted with 1, and false with 0, then:

- AND: 1 A 1 → 1, 1 A 0 → 0, 0 A 1 → 0 , 0 A 0 → 0
- XOR: 1 X 1 → 0, 1 X 0 → 1, 0 X 1 → 1 , 0 X 0 → 0
